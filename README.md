# Pic-Orbit
The "Pic Orbit" game. Allows you to view your favorite images spinning in a fantastic, interactive arena

I created this a year ago without using github; this is the initial commit.

- Download and extract PicOrbitBuild7.rar
- Download and extract the assets.rar folder if you want sample images and music
- Run 'Pic Orbit 7.exe', at the image path prompt, enter the full path to the folder containing your pictures

Fun facts, I made the images and music in the assests folder!
